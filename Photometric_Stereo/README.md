# Photometric Stereo
  
Reconstructing the shape of an object is an interesting and sometimes challenging task that generally requires more information than what is available from a single image. The simplest approach is to take three shaded images rather than one, but vary the position of the light source. This is **photometric stereo**. In this section we will implement some interesting (and simpler) parts of the following paper:
